# PicoCTF Writeups

This repository contains my writeups for various challenges from PicoCTF, an online cybersecurity competition aimed at high school and college students. The challenges cover a wide range of topics, including cryptography, web exploitation, reverse engineering, and more.

## About PicoCTF

PicoCTF is an annual online cybersecurity competition organized by Carnegie Mellon University's CyLab Security and Privacy Institute. The competition is designed to teach students of all skill levels about cybersecurity and to inspire them to pursue careers in the field.

Each year, PicoCTF releases a new set of challenges that test participants' knowledge and skills in various areas of cybersecurity. The challenges are organized into categories, and participants can earn points by solving them. The competition is open to anyone, and participants can compete as individuals or as part of a team.

## About the Writeups

The writeups in this repository are meant to serve as a reference for anyone who is stuck on a particular PicoCTF challenge or wants to learn more about how to solve a certain type of challenge. They are not intended to be comprehensive guides, and there may be multiple ways to solve each challenge.

The writeups are organized by category, and each one includes a brief description of the challenge, a list of the tools and techniques used to solve it, and a step-by-step walkthrough of the solution. Some of the writeups also include code snippets or screenshots to help illustrate the solution.

## Getting Started

To use this repository, simply navigate to the folder of the category you're interested in and look for the challenge you want to solve. Each folder contains a separate README.md file for each challenge.

The writeups assume that you have a basic understanding of cybersecurity concepts and tools, such as command-line interfaces, programming languages, and common cybersecurity tools like Wireshark and Burp Suite. If you're new to cybersecurity, you may want to start with some of the beginner-level challenges and work your way up.

## Contributing
