# Search Source â†’ 100 Pts.

1. We need to check the source files as indicated in the question.
2. Searched "Flag" on index.html but it said it's not there and it is located somewhere else.
3. Started searching the files in Debugger, Sources and Style Editor and inside Style Editor I found the file called style.css and that file contained a comment showing the flag.
