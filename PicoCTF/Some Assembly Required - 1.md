# Some Assembly Required - 1    â†’  70Pts.

1. We have a input page.

2. We have to enter flag and it will verify it and revert back Incorrect or Correct.

3. I inserted random number and text but nothing happened and reverted only Incorrected.

4. So started inspecting the page.

5. Went to Sources and started Fuzzing the files.

6. Saw something unusual in the WASM directory and it had a file

7. Checked that file and found the flag.

8. Submitted the flag and it reverted back Correct.


## It was a simple challenge but came to know about WASM files and their structure.
