# Power Cookies → 200Pts.

1. We have a website stating that Online Gradebook and then a “Continue as a guest” option.

2. We click on that and go on but it says that “We apologize, but we have no guest services at the moment.”

3. So I opened the Cookies section and saw that the name of the cookies is “isAdmin” and the value is 0.

4. I tried changing the value to “1” and it reverted back the flag.

**Note:** This was not even a 50 Pt. flag and the previous cookie challenges made by MADSTACKS were totally out of the box but this one was trash for 200 Pts. MADSTACKS I miss you!
